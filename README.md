<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I currently work for the XRT Extended Reality Training Laboratory at UCF. 

From time to time I will post public code relating to projects that I have done at the university or associated events. 

Following my profiles will lead you to know I also worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology where I developed some tools and code for them as well. 

Mostly you will in my repositories either code relating to: 

- VR and AR
- Point cloud tools (New!) 
- Machine Learning scripts
- Visualizers for use in VR/AR/2D
- Random old coursework 

Thanks for visisting and please let me know if you need help on using anything.
